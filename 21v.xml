                <p>Draft of Frankenstein, [August or September] – [?December] 1816. | Bodleian MS. 
                    Abinger c.56 (formerly designated Dep. 477/1) consists of 62 leaves originally 
                    bound in Notebook A, one of two now disbound notebooks in which Mary W. Shelley 
                    (MWS) drafted the two-volume version of Frankenstein. The draft in c.56 runs 
                    from the beginning to the end of Volume I, concluding just as the Creature is 
                    about to begin his tale to Victor. </p>
